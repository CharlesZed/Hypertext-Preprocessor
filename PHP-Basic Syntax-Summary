  In the last seven days of studying the PHP Basic Syntax,i have learn a lot including install the apache server ,php,MySQL,Writing the Basic Syntax of PHP.
  Because i have learnt programming for three years in college ,studying Basic Syntax is a easy job for me.
  So i just summarize Something new to me:
  
  First:PHP fragment four kinds of representation.
  Standard tags: <?PHP ?>
  
  Short tags: <? ?> //need to setting short _open_tag = on in the PHP.ini , default(on)

  Asp tags: < % % > //need to setting short _open_tag = on in the PHP.ini, default(off)

  The script tags: < script language = "PHP" > < / script >
  
  
  
  Second:PHP variables and data types

  1) $variable, the variable can be initialed from a letter or _, but can not be initialed  Spaces

  2) Declare Variable $variable = value;

  3) weakly type language, direct assignment,needn't to display a statement data types

  4) basic data types:  Integer, Double, String, Boolean, Object(the Object or class), Array

  5) special data type: the Resourse (reference of third-party resources, such as databases), Null(empty, uninitialized variables)
  
  
  Third:array traversal:
  foreach:
  Syntax:
  foreach($array $key => $value){
  //loop
  }
  $array is the array which is needed to iterate
  $key and $value are variables
  needn't the artificial control loop foreach.
  Every foreac structure will, in turn, according to the read pointer keys and key values of the elements in an array, and assign a value to the variable $key and $value, after reading the element keys and key value, the pointer moves down a line, arrange another time to read.
  In accordance with the rules in this reading, until the pointer to the array at the end of the end of the cycle
